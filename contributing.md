# Contributing to Conquest of Munster
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Writing new stories that others can download and run

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. Make sure your code [Pylints](https://pylint.org/).
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project. By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the GNU GPL License. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/kiancliffe/CYOA-Text-Based-Game/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's [an example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect, on how to write a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports. 

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* You can try running `npm run Pylint` for style unification.
